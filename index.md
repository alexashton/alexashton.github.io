# Alex Ashton's GitHub page

This is my other portfolio site where I'm simply learning more how to use GitHub.

I'm currently a Platform Stability Associate at [Optoro](https://www.optoro.com) where my role consists of supporting SaaS platform and network operations, devops and developers, as well as acting as a client technical support analyst. I'm also a full time, third-year, remote student at Arizona State University. My bachelor of science degree will be in Technical Communication-User Experience through the ASU School of Integrated Arts & Sciences, with a major in Applied Business Data Analytics through the W.P. Carey School of Business.

Long term, I'm looking to work my way into a UX/UI front end type development position.
